            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:114968:4"/> latter End is the principal cause, why I have chosen this Text at this time, as very seasonable, and in some degree necessary:</p>
            <p>For which way so ever I look, I behold many Eyes glazed with Tears, and in those watery glasses I see streams of Grief flowing forth. Which way so ever I look, I behold many faces clouded with sadness, and in those black clouds behold showers of Sorrow gushing out.

                  <hi>Exo.</hi> 14.16</note> Rod of <hi>Moses,</hi> to divide these waves of Sorrow, lest they make a Deluge. And likewise it is in some degree necessary to provide a portion of holy Scripture, which may be like the<note n="(d)" place="margin">2 <hi>Kings</hi> 2.14.</note> Mantle of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lijah,</hi> to restrain these swelling floods of Grief, lest they over-run their bankes. Such a Text, such a portion of Scripture, is this, which I have read unto you. <hi>Wherefore comfort one another with these words.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The first word of the Text, <hi>Wherefore,</hi> is a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction illative, and doth like the<note n="(e)" place="margin">

            <p>The English word to comfort, is derived from the Latine word <hi>Confortare,</hi> to strengthen, for Grief is the <hi>privative</hi> contrary to Comfort, doth weaken the Vitals, obstruct the Animals, exhaust the radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal moisture, extinguish the natural heat, oppresse the Appetite, and causeth the Pulse, which is <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures Clock</hi> to strike false; and the Heart which is <hi>Natures Primum Mobile,</hi> to move slowly. Therefore whatsoever doth strengthen the Vitals, refresh the Animals, cherish the radical moisture, quickÄ the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural heat, recover the Appetite, and procure a nimble and equal motion in the Pulse and heart, is vulgarly called <hi>Comfort.</hi> But all this is onely cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal, and sensitive comfort, and may be plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully supplied from the wel-stored Herbal of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert <hi>Galenist,</hi> or from the subtile limbeck of a stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious <hi>Paracelsian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore there is a second sort of Comfort, which is incorporeal, and spiritual; answerable to which there is another Grief, which is inward and invisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; The proper effect of which Grief, is the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the rational Soul, in the moral Operations of it, by a misty over-clouding the <hi>Æ²nderstanding,</hi> a passionate perplexing the <hi>Will,</hi> a tumultuous di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbing the <hi>Memory,</hi> and a violent untuning the <hi>Affections.</hi> Such a Grief as this cannot be cured by any collegiate Dispensatory.

               <p>And now I wish for the learning of <hi>Moses,</hi> the doubled Spirit of <hi>Elijah,</hi> the Elocution of <hi>David,</hi> and the smooth utterance of <hi>Isajah;</hi> that I might to the glory of God, to the honour of the Dead, and to the imitation of the living, recount with Truth, and Modesty, those Excellent Vertues, and Super-natural Graces which exemplarily shined in him.</p>
               <p>But before I present an unpolished table of these lovely Vertues (the lines whereof ought to have been drawn by the curious pencil of some skilfull <hi>Apelles</hi>) give me leave to offer a short Narrative con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his Birth, Parents, and Education.</p>

               <p>His Education was liberal, that is, he was train<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up in a way of Learning; a way of late much neglected, and thereby over-grown with many ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemous herbs and infectious weeds; the which if Authority do not timely pull up, they will seed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Wildernesse of Errours, and draw us into the Labyrinths of Confusion.</p>

                  <hi>Mercury</hi> is not made of every wood, nor a Scholar of every block. And he expressed his aptitude, by his constant, and unconstrained industry about his book. I have been credibly informed, that his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther not prevailing with words, to bring him from his study, hath divers times risen from his bed in the night to put out his Candle. And when upon his Fathers second Marriage, his Mother in Law being something soure, denyed him the benefit of
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:114968:21"/> a Candle for his study, he did often make use of that Light, which our children call<note n="(i)" place="margin">

                  <hi>Gods Candle,</hi> that is, <hi>the Moon,</hi> and by the free reflection of those beams (his Eyes being young and good) prepared his dictates and exercises to his Schoolmasters great contentment.</p>
               <p>How good a Proficient he was in Grammaticall Learning, before he was admitted into the <hi>Æ²niver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity,</hi> may evidently appear; in that he was accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for an Usher, in the popularly-famous School of Mr. <hi>Puller</hi> of <hi>Epping,</hi> in the County of <hi>Essex,</hi> where he continued for the space of two years, or there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouts, hereby admonishing all Parents who dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate their children as<note n="(i)" place="margin">1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.28.</note> religious <hi>Hannah</hi> did dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate her young <hi>Samuel</hi> to the ministeriall service of God, not to launch them out too early into the sea of the <hi>Æ²niversity,</hi> but first to balast them with a good measure of Grammatical Learning, and with some staiednesse of Judgement, lest they be swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up in their voiage, by the quick sands of Ignorance, or ship-wrackt against the rocks of evil company, when they are in the Haven of Hope.</p>
               <p>From this School, which like a little River, did pay every year some tribute to the Ocean of the <hi>Æ²niversity,</hi> he removed to <hi>Cambridge,</hi> was admitted into <hi>QuÃ©enes Colledge,</hi> entertained by Doctor <hi>Preston</hi> as his Pupil, through the pleasing violence of a friendly Letter, which the foresaid Mr. <hi>Puller</hi> writ in his high commendation.</p>
               <p>The learned Doctor, notwithstanding the Letter, did take but ordinary notice of him, well knowing that the commendatory Lette<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="2 letters">

               <p>The Doctor was one night discoursing to his pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pils concerning that sublime, and incomprehensible mystery of the ever blessed Trinity; he clearly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it was<note n="(k)" place="margin">1 <hi>John</hi> 5.7. <gap reason="foreign">

The Doctor perceiving there were some hard knots in those Queries, tould him, he would take some time to untie them, the which he did the next night very satisfactorily. And from that time forward (as I am credibly informed) did cast an observing Eye, on this our Worthy Freind: not such an observing Eye as<note n="(l)" place="margin">1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18.9.</note>

               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:114968:22"/>
               <p>This Cordial Affection was demonstrated by the Doctor, when he was chosen to be Master of <hi>Emanuel Colledge,</hi> for he did not leave him behind, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving his growing parts in a pregnancy of Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, a solidity of Judgement, an unusual strength of Memory, and a prudential reservedness, as also observing that none of these perfections were tainted with the Flie of <hi>Pride,</hi> or corrupted with the Canker of <hi>Morosity,</hi> did translate him as a choice flower from the garden of <hi>Queenes Colledge,</hi> &amp; planted him as an Ornament in the Colledge of <hi>Ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuel,</hi> and ever after esteemed him, not onely as his beloved Pupil, but as his bosome friend, and most intimately private familiar.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Emanuel Colledge</hi> he was quickly honoured with a <hi>Fellowship.</hi> For such great parts could not be long obscured, and in a Colledge of so much Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, could not be long unrewarded, especially being illustrated with the propitious beams of so bright a Planet, as the Master of the Colledge. And whilst he was fellow, his learned Determinations in the Colledge, his elaborate common-places in the chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, his solid exercises in the Schools, his well studi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Sermons at St. <hi>Maries,</hi> his visible, and yet pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentially invisible government of the Colledge, his almost incredible multitude of Pupils, and his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defatigable pains in a faithful discharge of the high trust of their Education, did loudly proclaime him a <hi>Man of vast parts, and of singular excellency.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From this place, wherein he lived both in Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Plenty, (I speak knowingly what I speakâª) he was not onely invited, but importuned by the unanimous suffrages of this Corporation. Nay fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:114968:23"/> he was not onely entreated, but zealously solli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited by the affectionate Letters of the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ministers, to accept the heavy burthen of the charge of souls, in this populous Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.</p>
               <p>How slow this <hi>good Man</hi> was to undertake this burden, I have heard from his own mouth, and little wonder at it,<note n="(n)" place="margin">Vid. <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sost.</hi> de sacer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotio passim.</note> when I call to mind those necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry qualifications, wherewith every Minister of Christ ought to be furnished, and think upon the Question of the holy Apostle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.16. <hi>Who is suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for these things?</hi> But yet that he might not like <hi>Jonas,</hi> flie to <hi>Tarshish,</hi> when God gave him a call to <hi>Ninive,</hi> he would not acquiesce in his own Judgement, but communicated the business to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Reverend Ministers, his worthy Friends, who were occasionally met at <hi>Cambridge,</hi> by reason of the Commencement; he desired them to appoint a meeting, for the debate of the Question concerning his stay or removal. These Reverend Ministers did appoint a time of meeting, and after the impartial ballancing of all arguments, they judged the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for his removal, to be the most weighty, in the scales of the Sanctuary; and agreed in this result; That they apprehended he might be more instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental in order to the Glory of God, &amp; to the salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Souls, in yielding to the earnest desires of so numerous a people as <hi>Northampton,</hi> then he was likely to be, in case he should refuse. Whereupon he expressed so much self-denyal, that he opened his Ears to the imporunities of this ancient corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Thus I have (through the assistance of your Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience)

                  <hi>Sauls</hi> Messengers were with an image, or as <hi>Ixion</hi> was with a cloud, let us look upon him, and upon them, through the un-erring perspective of
<pb facs="tcp:114968:26"/> his constant actings, in all those various Relations, wherein Divine Providence placed him, for as the Sun is known by his Light, and the Diamond by his sparklings, so is true Grace discovered by the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Operations of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The first Relation <hi>I</hi> knew him in, was of a Tutor to his Pupils, a Relation which will bring Grace and Vertue to the test, a Relation wherein he expressed so great a measure of Piety, Charity, Learning, Art, Industry, and Sincerity, that <hi>Dr. Preston</hi> upon his Death-bed bequeathed<note n="(i)" place="margin">Mr. <hi>Fiennes</hi> Brother to the right Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable the Earl of <hi>Lincoln.</hi>
                  </note> his most eminent Pupils to his care, and Tuition.</p>
               <p>It is recorded of <hi>Alured</hi> King of <hi>England,</hi> that he divided the natural day into three parts; One part he spent in matters of Religion,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Rich,</hi> son to the right Honourable the late Earl of <hi>Warwick.</hi> Sir <hi>Gilbert Pickering,</hi> &amp;c.</note> another part in matters of Justice and Government, a third part in Sleep, Food, and Recreation. But this eminent Divine, did spend the most part of the day, in the promotion of Godlinesse and Learning. For every Morning he read to his pupills, <hi>Logick, Ethicks,</hi> and <hi>Philosophy,</hi> in the Afternoon he read unto them, <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Hebrew,</hi> at 8. of the clock, every Night, his Pupils met in his Chamber, where upon several nights, several Excercises were performed. Some Nights were appointed for Orations, other Nights for Disputations. Every Night all the under gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duates did shew unto him some few remarkable Collections, out of those Authors which he appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to read. So that there was neither Day nor Night <hi>sine linea,</hi> without some seasonable academi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call employment. âBut this was not all, for so soon as the prementioned Exercitations were
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:114968:27"/> dispatched, then a Chapter, either out of the Old Testament, or out of the New, was constantly read, the which Chapter he would exactly analyze accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the rules of Art, without looking upon a Bible. After this Brief Analyze, he would hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somely draw aside the curtaine of Obscurity, from any very difficult Verse in that Chapter, then he would acutely hint some few practical Observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for the rule of a good life, and lastly close up all with a prayer unto God. This was the laborious method, and constant practice of this most reverend Minister, all the while I had the honour and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to enjoy the happy communion of his Tuition.</p>
               <p>His second Relation was conjugal, wherein God pleased to make him much happier then <hi>Solomon,</hi> for <hi>Solomon</hi> certifies us, <hi>Ecclesiastes</hi> 7.28. <hi>That he had found one good man amongst a thousand, but a good woman a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all these he had not found.</hi> But this our worthy friend was blessed in the Marriage of three Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and Vertuous Gentlewomen, the last of which is now surviving, whose tender Affections, sincere Love, unwearied Diligence, and exemplary Piety, will render her both beloved, and respected in the Hearts and Tongues of all those who value Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and prize Vertue.</p>
               <p>How this ReverÄd Minister acted under this multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied relatiÅ, is known to very mÄy of you. And that he acted according to the sure principles of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Prudence, may be demonstrated from the real Love, complacentious agreement, perpetual faithfulness, and affectionate Observance expressed
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:114968:27"/> from every one of these <hi>Wives</hi> unto him. I shall conclude this with that of <hi>Solomon, Proverbs</hi> 19.14. <hi>Honour and Riches are the inheritance of Fathers, but a prudent Wife is from the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His third Relation was paternal, and herein God hath blest him with a hopeful posterity, my Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to them is this. That they endeavour to grow in the habits and exercises of Grace and Vertue: that so their religious, prudent, and humble con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation may be the living <hi>Monuments of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Worth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His fourth and last Relation was Ministerial, wherein he shewed himself a wise Master builder in the Church of God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the Word of Truth.</p>
               <p>And now I am entred into a most pleasant Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, beautified with many lovely, and sweet flowers, and know not which sort of flowers to crop, that I may without tediousnesse compose a fragrant Garland to crown his Temples withall.

<pb n="51" facs="tcp:114968:28"/> Sermons. It is true he had a Conduit within him, but it must needs waste his Vitals, and weaken his Voice to turn the Cock so often. Moreover you may remember, that when you eased him of the burden of the Weekly Lecture, by taking it on your own shoulders, that then (though he was by reason of his Age, <hi>rude donandus,</hi> to be priviledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from Polemical Service) you demonstrated your high Opinion of his Piety, Prudence, Learning, Oratory, and Solidity, in that you did make choice of him (by a common suffrage, <hi>Nemine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicente</hi>) to compose a tract concerning the Gospel authority of <hi>Ministers,</hi> and the necessity of <hi>Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to constitute a lawful Minister of Jesus Christ.</hi> The which tract he published about two years before he dyed, of which tract I shall say but thus. <hi>It is a learned, Pious, and very rational Tract,</hi> woven with an even, and a strong thread, beautified with a more then ordinary <hi>Moderation.</hi>

<pb n="52" facs="tcp:114968:29"/> Spirit, are the thankful Witnesses of God in him; Whereby he could bind up the broken hearted, with a sweet Meeknesse, and apply the Balm of <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lead</hi> to the bleeding Soul, with a winning tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse: he had an excellent gift to heal them, who felt the Arrowes of the Almighty stick fast in them, so that the poyson thereof did drink up their strength, he had a Divine Art to comfort them, who walked in darknesse and did see no light, so that they said at Evening, when will it be Morning, and at Morning when will it be Evening.</p>
               <p>I must conclude, (craving pardon for my omission of many material things) he was visited with a long sickness, w<seg rend="sup">ch</seg> crept upon him <hi>pedetentim</hi> by degrees, his sickness was an apoplectical distemper, a distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to which hard studÄts are vere prone, &amp; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as divers eminent<note n="(q)" place="margin">

This distemper according to the nature of that dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease, did seize upon the <hi>Animal Spirits,</hi> and thereby did not onely occasiÅ him <hi>divers times to fall,</hi> both at home &amp; abroad, before he was sick (for such a strong Castle as his Braine was, could not with two or three assaults be stormed by any ordinary <hi>Apoplexy</hi>) but likewise prevailed so far in the time of his sickness, that it weakned his Memory, &amp; clouded his intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals, so that he could not express his inward Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the Beauty, and glory of them. But yet as the Sun doth sometimes break forth in lustre, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stÄding the overshadowings of the blackest clouds, so did he sometimes by sundry holy Ejaculations and spiritual Meditations, expresse to divers who were present, the inward Peace of his Soul, and the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:114968:29"/> sweet Communion he enjoyed with God.</p>
               <p>He was even at his last, sensible of Heavenly things in <hi>some good Measure.</hi> And when his Voice began to fail him, and one of his worthy Friends asked him, whether he desired to be with Christ, <hi>he lifted up his hands in token of consent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now I doubt not, but that <hi>he is with Christ:</hi> Oh happy is he to make so blessed an Exchange; to change sorrow for joy, labour for rest, sicknesse for health, mortality for eternity. I am perswaded he is in Heaven with the glorious company of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, the goodly fellowship of the Prophets, the noble army of Martyrs, and sings Hallelujahs with the quire of Angels, to him that sits upon the Throne, and to the Lamb for evermore.</p>
               <p>We have cause to mourn, not he, we have cause to lament, not he, we have lost, but he hath gained, we are grieved, but he is cÅforted, his work is done, and he is gon to <hi>receive</hi>
